## Intro Activity
- Homework from last week

## Homework
- An R project simply a folder where all scripts, data, and other content related to your project will exist
- Using the command `getwd()` aka "get working directory" will tell you which folder or project you are in
- Think of projects like rooms in a house and all your project content is stuff in that room
    - If you ask for your water bottle and there is one in the room you are in, that is likely the water bottle you are talking about even if there is a water bottle in a different room
- You can also reference other folders inside of your room, i.e. (In my house, in the living room, in the bottom right desk drawer there is a piece of paper I need)
    - `home/livingRoom/desk/bottomRightDrawer/paper.txt`
